After finishing a coding bootcamp, I found myself a bit overwhelmed with the numerous resources and time now available to dive into other topics beyond web development. While there are many blog posts about [starting to code](100daysofcoding_recap), what about next steps? To me, there are the following broad subject areas that likely overlap:
* [Mobile Development](mobile_development) (iOS, Android, Hybrid)
* Cloud Development (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure)
* Cybersecurity - [Cybrary](https://twitter.com/cybraryIT) and [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) are resources that I have yet to try out but have often seen.
* Data Science (Python, R, Hadoop)
* Machine Learning (TensorFlow, Keras)
* Blockchain (Ethereum, Ripple, Hyperledger)
* Virtual Reality (Unity, Unreal Engine, CryEngine)
* Video Games - Unity is also popular in this area

Two subscription-based services *with free trails available* that I have gotten into are [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) and [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/).

Pluralsight also owns [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/), which was my first go-to when self-studying before bootcamp enrollment. Pluralsight offers more video courses on a variety of IT and development areas. Itâ€™s great to get detailed step-by-step information on intermediate and advance topics.

A Cloud Guru has many dedicated video courses to AWS, responsible for most of the cloud industry, and other platforms. AWS certification is highly valuable and certainly draws a considerable audience to A Cloud Guru.

Both of these resources do have some quizzes or exercises but online videos are its bread and butter. As someone who is a huge visual learner, I wanted to share these resources that go beyond web development.
