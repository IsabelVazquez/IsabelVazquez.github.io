Although I have been coding for longer than 100 days now, I wanted to recap my first #100DaysOfCoding from earlier this year. I've **bolded** resources that I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to learn how to code, become a developer, or try something new. Stack Overflow and YouTube tutorials were also key in completing projects and tying smaller lessons together.

* completed [Codecademyâ€™s Learn JS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) track and started various [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) paths  

* finished **[Hack Reactor Basic Prep](http://prep.hackreactor.com/p/hack-reactor-prep)** - *This really forced me to read and become comfortable with [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) while learning the basics of JS.*

* did a live coding interview

* completed 4 projects (1 data visualization + 3 back end) with [**FreeCodeCamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - *After completing the tutorials above, I dived into small projects before enrolling at Flatiron School. I didn't know about setting up MVC patterns but coded along with video tutorials that I watched over and over to understand. GitHub, Heroku, and Git became more important to me at this point.*

* set up my local dev environment - *I didn't want to do this for the longest time but am thankful for [cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/?origin=c9io), [codepen](https://codepen.io/), [repl.it](https://repl.it/), and Learn IDE.*

* acquired 473 points at the **[Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/)** in 7 weeks with HTML/CSS, Ruby, SQL, OOP, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, and React lessons - *I took the route of completing as many labs as possible and doing the projects at the end. This was a personal choice, and I enjoyed gaining various learnings before tackling projects.*

Prior to Flatiron School, Hack Reactor Prep and FreeCodeCamp were my go-tos and definitely set up confidence and skills. There is no shortage of resources, and I hope that whatever you choose works for you!

I'm currently on my second #100DaysOfCoding and am focusing on algorithms with [base cs](https://medium.com/basecs), created by a Flatiron alumna!
