For this portfolio project, I started with the most MVP I could imagine at each iteration. 

That first meant having a basic CLI with no thought about scrapping data yet. 

My second iteration only dealt with scrapping data and creating objects. I picked a XML file of UNESCO World Heritage Sites with 1000+ data points. When organizing this into smaller chunks, I wished I had picked a smaller and cohesive set. Although users can see lists of 100 sites, they are not organized by continent or any other significant search.  

Then I raised my scraped objects into list and detail views within the CLI. 

My final iterations were about refactoring and making the CLI more user friendly. Ultimately, I enjoyed this project as it made me recognize the importance of solid data sets and user flow.
