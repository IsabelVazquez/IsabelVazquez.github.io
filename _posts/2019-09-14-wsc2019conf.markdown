**I finally went to my first tech conference, thanks to a giveaway by [Lizzie Siegle](https://twitter.com/lizziepika)!**

Overall, I would highly recommend this conference to URMs (under-represented minorities) in tech. The mission statement of Write/Speak/Code resonated with me, and the conference offers childcare, scholarships, and travel stipends. If you're unable to get funding for a ticket, they also provide volunteer opportunities that offer a free ticket in exchange.

*My experience:*
- As my first tech conference, I didn't have any previous expectations but assumed a welcoming community given the conference's mission. The inclusive vibe of the conference made it memorable, as well as the diversity I saw. I met various designers, PMs, and non-developer attendees. The importance of uplifting different perspectives and valuing **impact over intention** was a key lesson brought up again and again by the speakers.

- Infotainment is a big industry (thanks to recruiting) that provides networking and future inspired action. The reality of conferences is not to gain mastery of X, Y, or Z in a matter of days but to be inspired. That's the mindset that I'm adopting going into my next conference.

- The Growth track was my favorite track given the career pivots and non-linear paths shared. There are many avenues within technology and the track was a great reminder that it's never too late to change. The most memorable takeaway is that **success is different for everyone.**

- Another key takeaway was the existence of CFPs (Calls For Proposals). I vaguely knew they existed but never thought that they were meant for me but only for subject matter experts. Being introduced to them and being told to just **go for it** was inspirational. They're great for elevating your personal brand but also to teach and inspire others. I love writing and can't wait to dive into proposal writing. But don't write the entire talk until your proposal is accepted (unless you're really inspired)!

- The technical track and coding was a bit on the low end for me but I appreciated the speakers' talks on how technology can bring solutions to critical social issues. It's not solely about coding but thinking how our code affects people. It's not enough to identify design patterns but also question their current existence. I strongly navigated towards the Growth track the most, followed by the Speak track.

- Swag, so much swag! I loved the massive collection of stickers I gathered. #Octocat
