Since graduating from Harvard, I have been in the nonprofit and public relations industries where social analytics led to an interest in programming.

I enrolled at the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/)â€™s Full Stack Web Developer program where I gained experience in Rails and JavaScript-based programming. During the program, I built web applications to view and create todo lists, have a recipe-sharing community, and save images requested from an external API.

Always learning and expanding my technical skillset, I am looking forward to continuing my career as a developer. This blog is my space to share my learnings and process. A special thanks to the following organizations that have given me unprecedented opportunities: [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/), and [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/).
