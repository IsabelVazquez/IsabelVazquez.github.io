Full-stack developer with a passion for creating robust, reusable components. With experience in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript based programming and a background in international relations, I discovered programming through a desire to have routine tasks become more efficient and less time consuming. I bring strong skills in analytics and problem-solving that help companies identify and address challenges and drive results. Based in Dallas, TX, I'm open to mid-level opportunities in the area and remote.
